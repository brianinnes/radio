# Radio

This project is to build a FM radio that can listen in the 60-65MHz range as well as the more common frequencies above 87MHz.

In addition to creating the radio, the project is also going to be used to:

- Use a Li-Po rechargable battery with load sharing whilst charging
- Use an ARM-Cortex 0+ controller rather than the AT based controllers
- Create a custom circuit board using KiCad
